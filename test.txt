You are right, but Genshin Impact is a new open-world adventure game independently developed by Mihoyo. The story of this game takes place in a fantasy world called Teyvat, where those who have been chosen by gods will be granted Visions that are able to conduct the power of elements. You will play as a mysterious character named Traveler, and during your free journey, you will meet companions with different personalities and unique abilities, defeat powerful enemies, find the lost sibling - and meanwhile, gradually discover the truth of Allogenes.
